### 1. Visualization of Questionnaire Data with Python
created: 231026; shared: 240224
  
  Soundscape assessment methods such as soundwalks where participants fill in a questionnaire while the sound levels are measured with a sound level meter (SLM) can be used to study how people perceive the acoustic environment in a city. Analyzing the data obtained from a soundwalk is an important process that might influence the results and interpretation of an experiment if executed more or less effectively. This Jupyter Notebook was created to help solve some challenges of visualizing soundscape data collected based on Method A of ISO/TS 12913-2:2018.
